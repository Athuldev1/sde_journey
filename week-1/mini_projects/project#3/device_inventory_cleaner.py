Why?

In small scripts, people often just use print() to show output. But in professional code (what interviewers expect for backend/automation), we use logging because:

You can control the level of importance (INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

You can easily redirect logs to a file instead of console.

Logs include timestamps â†’ useful in production debugging.
